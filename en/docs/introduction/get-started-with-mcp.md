# Get started with MCP Servers

Bijira now includes support for MCP servers. It provides a complete solution for transforming existing APIs into intelligent, AI-ready tools. With a centralized control plane, Bijira simplifies the entire lifecycle of MCP server management—from creation to discovery—delivering a seamless experience for both API developers and AI agent builders.

In this tutorial, let's see how you can build an MCP server using a backend API and configure that with an AI Agent.

## Prerequisites

1. If you're signing in to the Bijira Console for the first time, create an organization:
    1. Go to [Bijira Console](https://console.bijira.dev/) and sign in using your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account.
    2. Enter a unique organization name.
    3. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.
    4. Click **Create**.

    This creates the organization and opens the organization home page.

## Step 1: Create a Project

1. Go to [Bijira Console](https://console.bijira.dev/) and sign in. This opens the organization home page.
2. On the organization home page, click **+ Create Project**.
3. Enter the following details:

    !!! info
        The **Name** field must be unique and cannot be changed after creation.

    | **Field**        | **Value**         |
    | ---------------- | ----------------- |
    | **Display Name** | Sample Project    |
    | **Identifier**   | sample-project    |
    | **Description**  | My sample project |

4. Click **Create**. This creates the project and takes you to the project home page.

## Step 2: Create an MCP Server

1. On the project home page, select **MCP Server** and select **Import API Contract** under **Expose APIs as MCP Servers**.

    !!!info
        If you need to create an MCP Server using an existing API Proxy, select the **Start from Existing API Proxy** option.
        You will be prompted to select an existing API on the next step.

2. Select **URL** for Contract, enter the service URL, and then click Next.
3. Click Create. This will create the MCP Server and deploy it to the Development environment.

## Step 3: Edit the MCP Tools (Optional)

1. You can modify the details of the Tools of your generated MCP Server by navigating to the *Policy* section under the *Develop* menu. The default tool names and descriptions are generated by Bijira based on the information available in the OpenAPI definition (service contract provided in the previous step).

    ![Edit MCP Tools](../../assets/img/introduction/mcp-policy-tools.png)

2. The following options are supported when modifying the Tools
    1. **Add new Tool** - You can create a new tool by selecting the **+** icon at the top. You have to provide the name and description at this stage. The schema will be auto generated once  you create the mapping to the REST resource
    2. **Edit Tool details** - You can modify the tool name and description of each tool by clicking on the Tool icon. The tool schema cannot be modified.
    3. **Delete Tools** - By default tools are created for all the resources of the API proxy or the backend service. You can remove unwanted ones by      deleting the tool.

    !!!tip
        Clear and well-defined tool names and descriptions make it easier for LLMs to recognize and use the tools effectively. If the auto-generated versions don’t meet your needs, you should feel free to customize them to better suit your use case.

3. You have to deploy the MCP Server again after saving for the new changes to be reflected in the gateway.

## Step 4: Test the MCP Server

You can test the MCP Server in the development environment before promoting it to production. Bijira provides our own version of **MCP Inspector** for this purpose.

1. Select **MCP Inspector** under the Test section.
2. Select Development from the environment drop-down list (If you have deployed the API to other environments, you can select the respective options as well).
3. Click on **Get Test Key** if the test key is not populated
4. Click on **Connect** to connect with your deployed MCP Server.

    !!!info
        This will send an **initialize** call to the MCP Server deployed in the gateway and establish a connection to the server.

    ![MCP Inspector](../../assets/img/introduction/mcp-inspector.png)

5. You can select and run individual tools by providing the necessary parameters if necessary.

    ???info
        Tool calling via the MCP Inspector is currently not supported for MCP Servers created from existing APIs.


## Step 5: Promote the MCP Server to Production

Once you verify that the MCP Server is working as expected in the development environment, you can promote it to production.

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.
2. In the Development card, click **Promote**.
3. In the Configuration Types pane, select the option Use Development endpoint configuration and click Next.

The Production card indicates the Deployment Status as Active when the MCP Server is successfully deployed to production.

If you want to verify that the MCP Server is working as expected in production, you can test the API in the production environment using the inbuilt MCP Inspector.

Now that your MCP Server is deployed in both development and production environments and can be invoked, the next step is to publish it so that consumers can discover and subscribe to it.

## Step 6: Publish the MCP Server

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop** and then click **Lifecycle**. This opens the Lifecycle page, where you can see the different lifecycle stages of the API. The current lifecycle stage is Created.
2. Click **Publish**.
3. In the Publish MCP Server dialog, click Confirm to proceed with publishing the MCP Server with the specified display name. If you want to change the display name, make the necessary changes and then click Confirm. This changes the lifecycle state to **Published**.

## Step 7: Integrate the MCP Server with an AI Agent

To generate credentials for the published API and invoke it via the Developer Portal, follow these steps.

1. In the Lifecycle Management pane, click **Go to DevPortal**. This takes you to the MCP Server published to the Bijira Developer Portal.
2. Subscribe to the MCP Server and Generate credentials.
    1. In the Developer Portal left navigation menu, click **Applications**.
    2. Click **Create**.
    3. Add a sample application name and click **Create**. This will create a new application. Click on the application name and it will navigate you to the application's home page.
    4. Click **Explore More** under the **Subscriptions** section. This will navigate you to the API proxy/MCP Server listing page.
    5. From the respective API card, choose the Application and click **Subscribe**. Now your application is subscribed to the published MCP Server with your selected subscription plan.
    6. Open the created application by selecting Applications from the left menu, and click on the application name.
    7. Click **Generate Key** under **OAuth2**. If you want to configure Advanced Configurations, click on the **Modify** button once the keys are generated and configure the values. Bijira generates new tokens and populates the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** fields.
    8. Click **Generate** from the **Token** section. This will generate an access token that you can use to invoke APIs. Copy the generated access token.
3. Go to the APIs listing page using the left navigation menu and select your MCP Server

    ![MCP in Devportal](../../assets/img/introduction/mcp-devportal-overview.png)

    !!!info
        The MCP Server url is shown as the **Production Endpoint** in the overview.

4. If you are using **VS Code Copilot Agent** to test this out, you can copy the MCP Server Configuration from the overview and add that as a server configuration in [VS Code’s mcp.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).
    1. Replace the placeholder with the token you generated in the previous step.
    2. Start the server through VSCode. If everything runs smoothly, it will connect within a few seconds and automatically detect the MCP Tools exposed by your MCP Server.
    3. Now you can try out the tools through the chat option in copilot.

    !!!important
        If you are using another AI Agent, you need to configure the MCP server url (Production Endpoint) and set the authorization token appropriately.
