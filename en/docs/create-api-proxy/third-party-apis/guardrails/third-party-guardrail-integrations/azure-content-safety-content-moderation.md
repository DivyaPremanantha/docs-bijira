# Azure Content Safety Content Moderation

This policy provides the capability to integrate [Azure Content Safety Content Moderation Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/contentsafety/text-operations/analyze-text?view=rest-contentsafety-2024-09-01&tabs=HTTP) to filter out harmful content in request bodies and AI-generated responses. This guardrail checks for hate speech, sexual content, self-harm, and violence, and can be applied to both requests and responses.

## Configure Azure Content Safety Content Moderation

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop**, then select **Policy**.

2. Click the Add policy icon in the required resource --> **Request/Response Flow** --> **Attach Mediation Policy**.

3. Add the policy information and click **Save**.
