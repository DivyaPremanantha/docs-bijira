# Regex Guardrail

This policy provides the capability to perform regular expression-based validation on incoming or outgoing JSON payloads. This component acts as a guardrail to enforce specific security or compliance rules based on configurable regex patterns and JSON path expressions.

## Configure Regex Guardrail

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop**, then select **Policy**.

2. Click the Add policy icon in the required resource --> **Request/Response Flow** --> **Attach Mediation Policy**.

3. Add the policy information and click **Save**.

    The following table lists and describes the configuration parameters available for the **Regex Guardrail** policy:

    | Parameter Name | Description |
    |----------------|-------------|
    | Guardrail Name | The name of the guardrail policy. This will be used for tracking purposes. |
    | Regex Pattern | The regular expression used to validate the content. |
    | JSON Path | The JSONPath expression used to extract content from the payload. If not specified, the entire payload will be used for validation. |
    | Invert the Guardrail Decision | If enabled, inverts the guardrail blocking decision, causing the guardrail to intervene and return an error response when a match is found in the content. |
    | Show Guardrail Assessment | When enabled, the error response will include detailed information about the reason for the guardrail intervention. |

4. Save the API and Deploy the API to apply the policy to the gateway.
