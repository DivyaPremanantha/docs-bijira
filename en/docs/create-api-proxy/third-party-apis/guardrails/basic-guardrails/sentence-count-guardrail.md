# Sentence Count Guardrail

This policy provides the capability to perform sentence count-based validation on incoming or outgoing JSON payloads. This component acts as a guardrail to enforce specific content moderation rules based on configurable minimum and maximum sentence counts and JSON path expressions.

## Configure Sentence Count Guardrail

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop**, then select **Policy**.

2. Click the Add policy icon in the required resource --> **Request/Response Flow** --> **Attach Mediation Policy**.

3. Add the policy information and click **Save**.

  The following table lists and describes the configuration parameters available for the **Sentence Count Guardrail** policy:

  | Parameter Name | Description |
  |----------------|-------------|
  | Guardrail Name | The name of the guardrail policy. This will be used for tracking purposes. |
  | Minimum Sentence Count | The minimum number of sentences the content must contain. |
  | Maximum Sentence Count | The maximum number of sentences the content can contain. |
  | JSON Path | The JSONPath expression used to extract content from the payload. If not specified, the entire payload will be used for validation. |
  | Invert the Guardrail Decision | If enabled, inverts the guardrail blocking decision, causing the guardrail to intervene and return an error response when the sentence count is within the specified range. |
  | Show Guardrail Assessment | When enabled, the error response will include detailed information about the reason for the guardrail intervention. |

4. Save the API and Deploy the API to apply the policy to the gateway.
