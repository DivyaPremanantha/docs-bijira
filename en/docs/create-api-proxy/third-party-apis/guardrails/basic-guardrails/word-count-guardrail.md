# Word Count Guardrail

This policy provides the capability to perform word count-based validation on incoming or outgoing JSON payloads. This component acts as a guardrail to enforce specific content moderation rules based on configurable minimum and maximum word counts and JSON path expressions.

## Configure Word Count Guardrail

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop**, then select **Policy**.

2. Click the Add policy icon in the required resource --> **Request/Response Flow** --> **Attach Mediation Policy**.

3. Add the policy information and click **Save**.

    The following table lists and describes the configuration parameters available for the **Word Count Guardrail** policy:

    | Parameter Name | Description |
    |----------------|-------------|
    | Guardrail Name | The name of the guardrail policy. This will be used for tracking purposes. |
    | Minimum Word Count | The minimum number of words the content must contain. |
    | Maximum Word Count | The maximum number of words the content can contain. |
    | JSON Path | The JSONPath expression used to extract content from the payload. If not specified, the entire payload will be used for validation. |
    | Invert the Guardrail Decision | If enabled, inverts the guardrail blocking decision, causing the guardrail to intervene and return an error response when the word count is within the specified range. |
    | Show Guardrail Assessment | When enabled, the error response will include detailed information about the reason for the guardrail intervention. |

4. Save the API and Deploy the API to apply the policy to the gateway.
