# URL Guardrail

This policy provides the capability to perform URL validity checks on incoming or outgoing JSON payloads. This component acts as a guardrail to enforce content safety by validating embedded URLs for accessibility or DNS resolution.

## Configure URL Guardrail

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop**, then select **Policy**.

2. Click the Add policy icon in the required resource --> **Request/Response Flow** --> **Attach Mediation Policy**.

3. Add the policy information and click **Save**.

The following table lists and describes the configuration parameters available for the **URL Guardrail** policy:

| Parameter Name | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Guardrail Name | The name of the guardrail policy. This will be used for tracking purposes. |
| Perform DNS Lookup | If enabled, a DNS lookup will be performed to validate the extracted URLs. If disabled, a connection attempt will be made instead. |
| Connection Timeout | The connection timeout for DNS lookups or connection attempts, in milliseconds. If not specified, a default timeout will be used. |
| JSON Path | The JSONPath expression used to extract URLs from the payload. If not specified, the entire payload will be used for validation. |
| Show Guardrail Assessment | When enabled, the error response will include detailed information about the reason for the guardrail intervention. |

4. Save the API and Deploy the API to apply the policy to the gateway.
