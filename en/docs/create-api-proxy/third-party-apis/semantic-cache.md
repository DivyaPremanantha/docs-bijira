# Semantic Caching

AI services frequently involve repetitive queries, leading to unnecessary token usage and increased latency. Bijiraâ€™s AI Gateway introduces semantic caching, allowing responses to similar requests to be cached and reused intelligently, minimizing redundant processing, improving response times, and reducing overall costs.


## Configure Semantic Caching Policy

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop**, then select **Policy**. 

    ![Semantic Cache Policy](../../assets/img/create-api-proxy/third-party-apis/ai-apis/semantic-cache/semantic-cache-policy.png)  

2. Click Add Resource Level Policy --> Request flow --> Attach mediation policy --> Semantic Caching

    ![Policy List](../../assets/img/create-api-proxy/third-party-apis/ai-apis/semantic-cache/semantic-cache-policy-select.png)  

3. Add the embedding provider and vector store configurations and click **Save**.

     ![Semantic Cache Policy Configs](../../assets/img/create-api-proxy/third-party-apis/ai-apis/semantic-cache/semantic-cache-policy-config.png)  

4. **Save** the API and **Deploy** the API to apply the policy to the gateway.

The configurable fields of the above policy have been described below.

| Field                    | Description                                                        | Example Value                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `Embedding Provider`     | AI provider used for generating embeddings (Azure OpenAI or Mistral).| `Azure OpenAI`              |
| `Auth Header Name`       | Header name for authentication <br>(<i>Use the header name ```Authorization``` for Mistral and ```api-key``` for Azure OpenAI.</i>).         | `api-key`             |
| `API Key`                | API key for authenticating with the embedding provider.            | `49fdadxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`       |
| `Embedding Model Name`   | Specific embedding model to use from the provider.                 | `text-embedding-ada-002`    |
| `Embedding Upstream URL` | Endpoint URL of the embedding service.                             | `https://example.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/xxxxx/embeddings?api-version=2025-07-21` |
| `Vector Store`           | Type of vector database to store embeddings <br><i>(Currently only Redis is supported)</i>.     | `Redis`                     |
| `Host`                   | Host address of the vector database.                               | `redis-xxxxx.us-east.ec2.redis-cloud.com`                 |
| `Port`                   | Network port number of the vector database.                        | `6379`                      |
| `Dimensions`             | The dimensionality of the vectors generated from the selected embedding model. (<i>Refer to the provider's official documentation to find out the exact values</i>).                        | `1536`                      |
| `Threshold`              | Dissimilarity threshold which is a decimal value for semantic matching that determines the required similarity for cache matches. <br>[<i>**Note**: Lower values (closer to 0) enforce stricter semantic similarity, while higher values allow weaker matches. Typical range: 0.0 (exact) to higher values (e.g., 0.5, 1.2, etc.</i>)]. | `0.1`                       |
| `Username`               | Username for database authentication.                              | `newuser`                     |
| `Password`               | Password for the specified database user.                          | `securepassword123`         |
| `Database`               | Index of the vector database to connect to.                         | `0`             |

## Next Steps

- **Verify** it is properly redeployed to ensure the policy and the configurations are properly applied.  

- **Test the AI API** to ensure it properly cache and serves those cached responses upon receiving semantically similar queries. See [Test REST Endpoints via the OpenAPI Console](../../test-api-proxy/openapi-console.md).  
 

By configuring semantic caching as outlined above, you can efficiently optimize AI service usage within your Bijira environment, significantly reducing latency and operational costs.
